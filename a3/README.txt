I wasn't able to make it to the demo in class, so I thought I'd make a little
readme. This is a little game based off Flappy Bird, a fairly difficuly, but
very simple, mobile / flash game. The only control is left click, which propels
you slightly upward. The goal is to make it as far as possible. Scoring is
calculated when the pillars go off screen. You can look at it at the address
above if you want.

The text is made with two canvases overlayed on each other. One is for the game,
the other is for the text, which is fill in with fillText.


Controls:
    Start Game = left click
    jump = left click
    restart = restart button in the bottom left
